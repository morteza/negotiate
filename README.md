# Social Negotiate

---

Simulate realtime web-based negotiation over money and other resources between two parties. It was part of an academic experiment in the field of social psychology.

In addition to regular entrance for users, it supports Amazon Mechanical Turk to enter a negotiation board, to crowd-sourced studies.

The story behind negotiation is currently just over resources after an earthquake and negotiated over vital resources. But it's designed in such a method to add other kinds of stories behind negotiations and other kind of resources.
